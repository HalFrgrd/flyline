## Completions

### First word Completions
`gre` -> find builtins, files that start with `grep`.
Should this be a fuzzy search?

### Programmable command completion functions
`git com` should call the git completion script and return `commit`.
The word uner the cursor (`com`) should be replaced with the suggestion (`commit`)

### Default completion
Find files in cwd.

### Variable completion
`echo $HO` -> replace `$HO` with `$HOME`

### Username completion
`cd ~to` -> expand `~to` to `~tonybababuci`

### glob expansions
`ls *.txt` tab should expand to all files matching this pattern.


## Text editor like stuff
- Syntax highlighting
- Automatically closing `"'({[` and backticks.
- When the cursor is on the opening / closing char, the closing / opening char is indicated.
- Hovering over command to show path
- Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y
- Selecting text with cursor / arrow keys
- cutting and copying selected text
- line numbers in multiline input

# MacOS 
How does it all work with command instead of control?


## Starship integration
Lazily evaluate the the git part of the prompt in the background.
When it finishes, replace the placeholder.

## Handle bash not accepting the line


## Final prompt when command runs
I think there is a bash prompt for this already, so dont overwrite.
